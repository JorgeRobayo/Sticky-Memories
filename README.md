# Web Application Overview

## Frontend (React)

### Components

Built with React, the application includes a `MenuListItem` component for displaying individual items, featuring an image, name, price, and an "ADD" button.

### Styling

CSS modules (`MenuListItem.module.css`) are used for styling components, defining layout, colors, and appearance.

### Category and Item Data

Categories and items are defined in the backend using Mongoose schemas, with initial data populated in the script.

### Category and Item Rendering

Categories and items are fetched from the database in the backend and dynamically rendered on the frontend.

### Emoji Usage

Emojis serve as a visual representation for items, associated with each item and displayed on the frontend.

## Backend (Node.js, Express, MongoDB)

### Database Connection

The backend connects to a MongoDB database using Mongoose.

### Schemas

Mongoose schemas define the structure of data for Category and Item.

### Data Population

An asynchronous function deletes existing categories and items and populates the database with new ones.

### Express Server

The script sets up an Express server with routes for managing categories and items.

### Category and Item Routes

Routes handle CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for categories and items.

### Initialization

The script initializes the application by deleting existing data and creating new categories and items.

## Image Display Issue

An issue with displaying images for the 'Hamburgersa' item may be related to the `imgUrl` property;

## Future Fixes

- **Dynamic Rendering:** Dynamically rendering categories and items on the frontend based on fetched data.
- **Error Handling:** Implement error handling in backend routes for better management.
- **Image Paths:** Double-check and ensure correct image paths specified in item data.

## How Information Is Sent Through the Code

### Frontend (React)

#### Rendering Items

The `MenuListItem` component passes down information about a specific menu item using the `menuItem` prop.

#### Displaying Information

`MenuListItem` uses the `menuItem` prop to display information like `name`, `imgUrl`, `price`, etc.

#### Handling Add to Order

The `handleAddToOrder` function is passed down and triggered when the user clicks the "ADD" button.

#### CSS Styling

Information like `name`, `price`, and `imgUrl` dynamically styles the `MenuListItem` component.

### Backend (Node.js, Express, MongoDB)

#### Data Retrieval

In the backend script, data is fetched from the MongoDB database using Mongoose.

#### Data Population

Data is populated into the MongoDB database using Mongoose's `create` method.

#### Express Routes

Routes in Express handle category and item data.

#### CRUD Operations

CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) are performed on categories and items.

#### Sending Data to Frontend

Data fetched from the database is sent to the frontend as a response to HTTP requests.

## Image Display Issue

The image path issue for 'Hamburgersa' may involve ensuring that the correct path is specified in the `imgUrl` property for that specific item. If the image is not displaying, it could be due to an incorrect path or file not being present in the specified location.

This explanation is based on the provided code, and it reflects the approach in building and troubleshooting the application. If you have specific questions or areas you'd like more clarification on, feel free to ask!


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
